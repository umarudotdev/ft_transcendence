# Chapter I

# AI Instructions

## ● Context

During your learning journey, AI can assist with many different tasks. Take the
time to explore the various capabilities of AI tools and how they can support
your work. How- ever, always approach them with caution and critically assess
the results. Whether it’s code, documentation, ideas, or technical explanations,
you can never be completely sure that your question was well-formed or that the
generated content is accurate. Your peers are a valuable resource to help you
avoid mistakes and blind spots.

## ● Main message

```
☛ Use AI to reduce repetitive or tedious tasks.
☛ Develop prompting skills — both coding and non-coding — that will benefit your
future career.
☛ Learn how AI systems work to better anticipate and avoid common risks, biases,
and ethical issues.
☛ Continue building both technical and power skills by working with your peers.
☛ Only use AI-generated content that you fully understand and can take responsibility
for.
```

## ● Learner rules:

- You should take the time to explore AI tools and understand how they work, so
  you can use them ethically and reduce potential biases.
- You should reflect on your problem before prompting — this helps you write
  clearer, more detailed, and more relevant prompts using accurate vocabulary.
- You should develop the habit of systematically checking, reviewing,
  questioning, and testing anything generated by AI.
- You should always seek peer review — don’t rely solely on your own validation.

### ● Phase outcomes:

- Develop both general-purpose and domain-specific prompting skills.
- Boost your productivity with effective use of AI tools.
- Continue strengthening computational thinking, problem-solving, adaptability,
  and collaboration.

### ● Comments and examples:

- You’ll regularly encounter situations — exams, evaluations, and more — where
  you must demonstrate real understanding. Be prepared, keep building both your
  technical and interpersonal skills.
- Explaining your reasoning and debating with peers often reveals gaps in your
  un- derstanding. Make peer learning a priority.
- AI tools often lack your specific context and tend to provide generic
  responses. Your peers, who share your environment, can offer more relevant and
  accurate insights.
- Where AI tends to generate the most likely answer, your peers can provide
  alter- native perspectives and valuable nuance. Rely on them as a quality
  checkpoint.

```
✓ Good practice:
I ask AI: “How do I test a sorting function?” It gives me a few ideas. I try them out
and review the results with a peer. We refine the approach together.
```

```
✗ Bad practice:
I ask AI to write a whole function, copy-paste it into my project. During peer-
evaluation, I can’t explain what it does or why. I lose credibility — and I fail my
project.
✓ Good practice:
I use AI to help design a parser. Then I walk through the logic with a peer. We catch
two bugs and rewrite it together — better, cleaner, and fully understood.
```

```
✗ Bad practice:
I let Copilot generate my code for a key part of my project. It compiles, but I can’t
explain how it handles pipes. During the evaluation, I fail to justify and I fail my
project.
```

# Chapter II

# Preamble

First of all, **congratulations on reaching this milestone!** You are now
entering the final project of your Common Core, and yes, it will not be easy.

Transcendence is a **group project (4-5 people)** , which is intended to boost
your creativity, self-confidence, adaptability to new technologies, and
**teamwork skills**. You’ll create a real-world web application **as a team**
that can move in many directions, depending on the modules you choose and the
choices you make. Make sure to think things through together as a team before
you start. The project is divided into two parts:

- The **mandatory part** , which is the fixed core of the project to which
  **every team** **member must contribute**.
- A set of **modules** , which you can choose and which count toward the final
  grade.

```
This is a long group project. Poor early choices and lack of
team coordination will cost a lot of time. Your project and team
management will strongly impact your results. All team members must
actively participate and contribute to both the mandatory part and
the modules.
```

### II.1 Team Organization and Project Management

As this is a group project, proper team organization is crucial for success. You
must establish clear roles and responsibilities from the start.

#### II.1.1 Required Team Roles

Your team **must assign** the following roles (one person can have multiple
roles if the team has 4 members):

- **Product Owner (PO)** : Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, and
  en- sures the project meets user needs. ◦ Maintains the product backlog.

```
◦ Makes decisions on features and priorities.
◦ Validates completed work.
◦ Communicates with stakeholders (evaluators, peers).
```

- **Project Manager (PM) / Scrum Master** : Facilitates team coordination and
  removes obstacles. ◦ Organizes team meetings and planning sessions. ◦ Tracks
  progress and deadlines. ◦ Ensures team communication. ◦ Manages risks and
  blockers.
- **Technical Lead / Architect** : Oversees technical decisions and
  architecture. ◦ Defines technical architecture. ◦ Makes technology stack
  decisions. ◦ Ensures code quality and best practices. ◦ Reviews critical code
  changes.
- **Developers** (all team members): Implement features and modules. ◦ Write
  code for assigned features. ◦ Participate in code reviews. ◦ Test their
  implementations. ◦ Document their work.

```
Team Size:
```

- **4 people** : Some members will have multiple roles (e.g., PM + Developer,
  PO + Developer).
- **5 people** : Roles can be more specialized, with dedicated PO, PM, Tech
  Lead, and 2 Developers. All roles must be clearly documented in your
  README.md.

#### II.1.2 Recommended Project Management Practices

While not mandatory, we strongly recommend implementing some basic project
manage- ment practices to help your team succeed:

- **Regular communication** : Meet regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) to sync on
  progress and blockers.
- **Task organization** : Use simple tools like GitHub Issues, Trello, or even a
  shared document to track who does what.

- **Work breakdown** : Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
- **Code reviews** : Try to have at least one other team member review important
  code changes.
- **Documentation** : Keep notes of important decisions and how things work.
- **Communication channel** : Use Discord, Slack, or similar for quick team
  commu- nication.

```
These practices are recommendations to help you organize your work.
Find what works best for your team! The important thing is that
everyone contributes and the work is well-coordinated.
```

```
During evaluation, the team will be asked to explain:
```

- How roles were distributed.
- How work was organized and divided.
- How you communicated and coordinated as a team.
- How each member contributed to the project. All team members must be able to
  explain the project and their contributions.

# Chapter III

# Mandatory part

**The project content is up to you.** Yes, you have to bring your own ideas and
decide together what application to build as a team.

It’s a step forward from what you did previously in the Common Core. You need to
think about the project as a whole, not just the features you’re going to
implement.

Of course, you won’t be completely free—there are constraints—but the idea is
yours.

### III.1 What are we doing?

First, you will have to create a comprehensiveREADME.mdfile. The detailed
requirements for the README are specified in the README Requirements section at
the end of this document.

```
Project Examples: Your project can take many forms. Here are some
valid examples:
```

- A multiplayer Pong game with tournament system
- A collaborative platform with real-time features
- A social network with user interactions
- An online game (Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc.) with matchmaking
- A project management application
- Any other creative web application that meets the requirements The key is to
  create something engaging that demonstrates your technical skills and
  creativity.

### III.2 General requirements

Building an entire project is complicated, and many things can go wrong. To help
you, we will provide a list of general requirements that you must follow. If you
don’t follow them, your project will be rejected.

The requirements are the following:

- The project must be a web application, and requires a frontend, backend, and a
  database.
- Git must be used with clear and meaningful commit messages. The repository
  must show: ◦ Commits from all team members. ◦ Clear commit messages describing
  the changes. ◦ Proper work distribution across the team.
- Deployment must use a **containerization solution** (Docker, Podman, or
  equiva- lent) and run with a single command.
- Your website must be compatible with the latest stable version of **Google
  Chrome**.
- No warnings or errors should appear in the browser console.
- The project must include accessible **Privacy Policy** and **Terms of
  Service** pages with relevant content.

```
Privacy Policy and Terms of Service: These pages will be verified
during evaluation. They must:
```

- Be easily accessible from the application (e.g., footer links).
- Contain relevant and appropriate content for your project.
- Not be placeholder or empty pages. Missing or inadequate Privacy Policy/Terms
  of Service pages will result in project rejection.

```
Multi-user Support (Mandatory): Your website must support multiple
users simultaneously. This is a core requirement of the project.
Users should be able to interact with the application at the same
time without conflicts or performance issues. This includes:
```

- Multiple users can be logged in and active at the same time.
- Concurrent actions by different users are handled properly.
- Real-time updates are reflected across all connected users when applicable.
- No data corruption or race conditions occur with simultaneous user actions.

### III.3 Technical requirements

This section, like the previous one, is mandatory. You will then be able to
choose the modules you want to use in the next chapter.

- A frontend that is clear, responsive, and accessible across all devices.
- Use a **CSS framework or styling solution** of your choice (e.g., Tailwind
  CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Styled Components, etc.).
- Store credentials (API keys, environment variables, etc.) in a local.envfile
  that is ignored by Git, and provide an.env.examplefile.
- The database must have a clear schema and well-defined relations.
- Your application must have a basic **user management system**. Users must be
  able to sign up and log in securely: ◦ At minimum: **email** and **password**
  authentication with proper security (hashed passwords, salted, etc.). ◦
  Additional authentication methods (OAuth, 2FA, etc.) can be implemented via
  modules.
- All forms and user inputs must be properly validated in both the frontend and
  backend.
- For the backend, **HTTPS** must be used everywhere.

```
What is a Framework? For this project, a framework is defined as a
comprehensive tool that provides:
```

- A structured architecture and conventions for organizing code.
- Built-in features for common tasks (routing, state management, etc.).
- A complete ecosystem of tools and libraries. **Examples:**
- **Frontend frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js (these are
  frameworks).
- **Backend frameworks:** Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, Flask, Ruby on
  Rails.
- **Not frameworks:** jQuery (library), Lodash (utility library), Axios (HTTP
  client). Note: React is considered a framework in this context due to its
  ecosystem and architectural patterns, even though it is technically a library.

# Chapter IV

# Modules

You will need to earn **14 points** in total to complete your project. Each
major module is worth **2 points** , and each minor module is worth **1 point**.

The following categories are available. You may choose multiple modules from any
cate- gory:

- **Web**
- **Accessibility and International-** **ization**
- **User Management**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Cybersecurity**
  - **Gaming and user experience**
  - **Devops**
  - **Data and Analytics**
  - **Blockchain**
  - **Modules of choice**

We strongly recommend choosing modules only after your ideas are clear and you
have a good understanding of what you want to build.

Additionally, aiming for more than **14 points** in total may be a good idea,
especially if some modules aren’t validated during the evaluation.

**Important - Module Dependencies and Evaluation:**

- Some modules require other modules to be implemented first (marked with info
  notes).
- **Gaming modules** (AI Opponent, Tournament, Game customization, Spectator
  mode, Multiplayer 3+, Add another game) **require that** **at least one game
  be implemented first**.
- The Game Statistics module requires that a game be implemented.
- Advanced chat features require the basic chat functionality from the "User
  interaction" module.
- SSR is incompatible with the ICP blockchain backend.
- Plan your modules carefully to ensure they work together coherently!
- **During evaluation** : You will be asked to demonstrate each claimed module.
  Only fully functional and properly implemented modules will be counted toward
  your final score. Non-functional or incomplete modules = 0 points.

These are just ideas to inspire you. The key is to choose a project that:

- Interests your team and motivates everyone to work on it.
- Allows you to implement the required modules (14 points minimum).
- Demonstrates technical complexity and creativity.
- Can be realistically completed within the project timeline.
- Has coherent module combinations that work well together. Discuss with your
  team, review the available modules, and choose wisely!

# Chapter VI

# Readme Requirements

AREADME.mdfile must be provided at the root of your Git repository. Its purpose
is to allow anyone unfamiliar with the project (peers, staff, recruiters, etc.)
to quickly understand what the project is about, how to run it, and where to
find more information on the topic. TheREADME.mdmust include at least:

- The very first line must be italicized and read: _This project has been
  created as part_ _of the 42 curriculum by \<login1\>[, \<login2\>[,
  \<login3\>[...]]]._
- A “ **Description** ” section that clearly presents the project, including its
  goal and a brief overview.
- An “ **Instructions** ” section containing any relevant information about
  compilation, installation, and/or execution.
- A “ **Resources** ” section listing classic references related to the topic
  (documen- tation, articles, tutorials, etc.), as well as a description of how
  AI was used — specifying for which tasks and which parts of the project.

```
➠ Additional sections may be required depending on the project (e.g., usage
examples, feature list, technical choices, etc.).
```

_Any required additions will be explicitly listed below._

- The “Description” section should also contain a clear name for the project and
  its key features.
- The “Instructions” section should mention all the needed prerequisites
  (software, tools, versions, configuration like .env setup, etc.), and
  step-by-step instructions to run the project.

#### Additional sections required for this activity:

- **Team Information** : For each team member mentioned at the top of the
  README.md, you must pro- vide: ◦ Assigned role(s): PO, PM, Tech Lead,
  Developers, etc. ◦ Brief description of their responsibilities.
- **Project Management** : ◦ How the team organized the work (task distribution,
  meetings, etc.). ◦ Tools used for project management (GitHub Issues, Trello,
  etc.). ◦ Communication channels used (Discord, Slack, etc.).
- **Technical Stack** : ◦ Frontend technologies and frameworks used. ◦ Backend
  technologies and frameworks used. ◦ Database system and why it was chosen. ◦
  Any other significant technologies or libraries. ◦ Justification for major
  technical choices.
- **Database Schema** : ◦ Visual representation or description of the database
  structure. ◦ Tables/collections and their relationships. ◦ Key fields and data
  types.
- **Features List** : ◦ Complete list of implemented features. ◦ Which team
  member(s) worked on each feature. ◦ Brief description of each feature’s
  functionality.
- **Modules** : ◦ List of all chosen modules (Major and Minor). ◦ Point
  calculation (Major = 2pts, Minor = 1pt). ◦ **Justification for each module
  choice** , especially for custom "Modules of choice". ◦ How each module was
  implemented. ◦ Which team member(s) worked on each module.
- **Individual Contributions** :

```
◦ Detailed breakdown of what each team member contributed.
◦ Specific features, modules, or components implemented by each person.
◦ Any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
```

Any other useful or relevant information is welcome (usage documentation, known
limitations, license, credits, etc.).

```
The README.md is a critical part of your project evaluation. It
should be:
```

- Clear and well-organized.
- Complete with all required sections.
- Professional and easy to read.
- Honest about contributions and challenges. A poor or incomplete README can
  negatively impact your evaluation.

# Chapter VII

# Submission and peer-evaluation

Submit your assignment in your Gitrepository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the evaluation. Double-check file names.

We highly recommend that you discuss your ideas with your team and peers before
starting to work on the project.

During the evaluation, a brief **modification of the project** may occasionally
be re- quested. This could involve a minor behaviour change, a few lines of code
to write or rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.

While this step may **not be applicable to every project** , you must be
prepared for it if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines.

This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the
project. The modification can be performed in any development environment you
choose (e.g., your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes
— unless a specific time frame is defined as part of the evaluation. You can,
for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a
display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc.

The details (scope, target, etc.) will be specified in the **evaluation
guidelines** and may vary from one evaluation to another for the same project.
