# SuperCluster Collision Phase 0 Baseline

Date: 2026-02-10

## Purpose
Record baseline status before implementation patches and define objective acceptance criteria for Phases 1-4.

## Baseline Source Docs
- `docs/supercluster/math-and-ecs-audit-2026-02-09.md`
- `docs/supercluster/issues/collision_improvements_validation_2026-02-09.md`

## Baseline Summary
- Current collision model is angular-space (dot/cos), not Euclidean distance.
- Main correctness/robustness gaps:
  - Degenerate billboard basis risk in projectile orientation.
  - Degenerate great-circle axis risk in movement.
  - Asteroid size type/runtime safety gap (`size: number`).
  - Projectile tunneling risk under frame spikes.
- Performance/scaling:
  - Projectile-asteroid checks are brute-force O(N*M).
  - Broad-phase is currently absent (optimization opportunity, not correctness bug).
- Documentation:

## Phase Completion Criteria

### Global Criteria
- No NaN matrices/quaternions generated by projectile/asteroid update paths.
- No NaN collision thresholds/radii from invalid asteroid size values.
- Collision behavior remains deterministic and visually stable.

### Phase 1 (Topics 1, 2, 3) Criteria
- Projectile orientation survives camera-alignment edge cases.
- Movement axis handling is safe when vectors approach degeneracy.
- Asteroid size is constrained at type level and defended at runtime boundaries.

### Phase 2 (Topic 4) Criteria
- Under frame spikes / low FPS, missed-hit rate is significantly reduced.
- Mechanics progression is decoupled from variable render frame duration.

### Phase 3 (Topic 6) Criteria
- Collision cost scales better than naive pair-check growth.
- Narrow-phase correctness remains unchanged.

### Phase 4 (Topic 5) Criteria
- Supercluster docs consistently use `Projectile` terminology.
- No conflicting collision-space descriptions across docs.

## Execution Note
Implementation should proceed in small patches:
1. Phase 1 (correctness)
2. Phase 2 (tunneling)
3. Phase 3 (performance)
4. Phase 4 (docs consistency)
